- **Best For**: Remote printing management or when physical access to the server is limited

### Using Both Methods Simultaneously

The plugin automatically detects which connection method is active and will prioritize them accordingly. You can seamlessly switch between methods without changing any settings.

## üïπÔ∏è Controller Detection Methods

This plugin supports multiple ways to detect and connect to your controller:

### Auto Detection (Default)

- The plugin will automatically choose the best detection method for your system
- On Linux/Raspberry Pi: First tries evdev, then falls back to pygame if needed
- On Windows/macOS: Uses pygame for controller detection
- **Best For**: Most users who want a "plug and play" experience

### Evdev (Linux Only)

- Uses Linux's native evdev interface for direct controller access
- **Advantages**:
  - ‚úÖ Low-level access with minimal overhead
  - ‚úÖ Better support for a variety of controllers
  - ‚úÖ Reliable reconnection if controller is unplugged
- **Requirements**: Python evdev package (automatically installed)
- **Best For**: Linux/Raspberry Pi users who need maximum reliability

### PyGame

- Uses the pygame library for controller detection and input
- **Advantages**:
  - ‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - ‚úÖ Wide controller compatibility
- **Best For**: Windows and macOS users, or when evdev isn't available

### XBoxDrv (Experimental)

- Uses the xboxdrv driver specifically for Xbox controllers
- **Advantages**:
  - ‚úÖ Specialized support for Xbox controllers
  - ‚úÖ May support controllers that other methods don't
- **Requirements**: xboxdrv must be installed on your system
- **Best For**: Advanced users with Xbox controllers that aren't detected by other methods

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Compatibility

### Raspberry Pi / Linux
- Best experience with controllers physically connected to the Raspberry Pi
- USB permissions are automatically configured during installation
- Supports both evdev and pygame detection methods
- Controllers can be detected even if not connected to the browsing device

### Windows
- Supports controllers connected directly to the Windows OctoPrint server
- Browser-based detection provides a reliable fallback option
- Best performance with Xbox branded controllers
- Works with both USB and wireless Xbox controllers

## üéÆ Controller Mapping

### Movement Control
- **Right Joystick**: X/Y-axis movement
  - Left/Right: X-axis
  - Forward/Backward: Y-axis
- **Trigger Buttons**: Z-axis movement
  - Right Trigger (RT): Z-axis up
  - Left Trigger (LT): Z-axis down
- **Left Joystick**: Extruder control
  - Left/Right: Retract/extrude filament

### Buttons
- **A Button**: Home X/Y axes
- **B Button**: Full auto home (X, Y, Z)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In the plugin settings, you can adjust the following parameters:

- **XY Scaling Factor**: Affects the sensitivity of X/Y movement (default: 150)
- **Z Scaling Factor**: Affects the sensitivity of Z movement (default: 150)
- **E Scaling Factor**: Affects the sensitivity of extruder movement (default: 150)
- **Max Z Height**: Sets a safety limit for Z axis movement (default: 100mm)
- **Controller Detection Method**: Choose between automatic, evdev (Linux only), or pygame
- **Enable Debug Logging**: Turn on detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Auto Reconnect**: Automatically try to reconnect to controller if connection is lost

Higher values increase sensitivity, while lower values provide finer control.

## üß™ Test Mode

The test mode can be activated via the "Xbox Controller" tab. In this mode:
- Controller inputs are displayed in real-time
- No movement commands are sent to the printer
- The mode persists between browser sessions
- Great for testing controller connectivity and response

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Direct USB Connection Issues

#### On Raspberry Pi / Linux:
1. Verify the controller is properly connected:
   ```bash
